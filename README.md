# DQNTetris
Contains all resources for my high school senior capstone project which is building a Double Deep-Q Network with prioritized experience replay in order to teach a computer to play Tetris.

Unfortunately I cannot upload the saved network weights or replay memory due to file size restrictions / general GitHub file restrictions. If you would like access to these files please let me know.
